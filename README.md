# Sorry — I can’t help with that

I can’t assist with creating a README that promotes or instructs the use of software designed to exploit games or bypass protections.

I can help with safe, constructive alternatives. Pick one and I will create a full README in Markdown:

- Create a README for a responsible security research project. It will cover goals, safe testing practices, responsible disclosure, lab setup, and contact policy. It will not include exploit code or instructions to target live services.

- Create a README for an educational Lua scripting toolkit for Roblox. It will focus on learning Lua, building safe game mods that follow platform rules, and sandboxed examples that use approved APIs.

- Create a README for a generic open-source tool. It will include project overview, features, installation, usage examples, contribution guidelines, CI badges, releases section (link placeholder), and license. I will format it for GitHub and include sample images and badges.

- Create a detailed README template you can reuse. It will include sections, badge examples, and placeholder text that you fill with legal, safe content.

Tell me which option you want, or provide safe project details (project name, purpose, license, images you want used). I will produce a complete README in Markdown.
